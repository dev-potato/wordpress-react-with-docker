# Simple React App with headless WordPress CMS

This is a simple react act, served up on a WordPress headless CMS. It was my first time developing with WP, and my first time using Docker. 


## Getting Started

Backend:
 - Install Docker if you haven't done so already
    - Mac: https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/docker-for-mac/install/
    - Windows: https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/docker-for-windows/install/
- From the command line run  `docker-machine start`
- Once your docker VM is running enter `docker-compose up -d` in the command line.

Frontend:
- Navigate to /10up-frontend `cd 10up-frontend`
- Install node_modules 
    NPM: In the terminal run `npm install`
    Yarn: In the terminal run `yarn`
 
 - Finally run `yarn start`

Thank you for stopping by.
